# MVP Authentication with NextAuth.js

## Task Overview

Implement a simple authentication flow using NextAuth.js to allow users to sign in with Google. Unauthenticated users will see a landing page with a "Sign in with Google" button, and authenticated users will see the main app (calendar, todos, etc.) with a sign-out option.

## Start Date

May 10th, 2024

## Technical Requirements

- **Dependencies:**
  - `next-auth`: For handling authentication
  - `@auth/google-provider`: For Google OAuth integration
- **API Requirements:**
  - Google OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret)
  - NextAuth.js configuration

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up NextAuth.js:**

   - Install `next-auth` and configure it in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`
   - Set up Google provider with your OAuth credentials

2. **Create Landing Page:**

   - Show a welcoming landing page with a "Sign in with Google" button
   - Redirect to the main app if the user is already authenticated

3. **Main App Access:**

   - Protect the main app routes (e.g., `/dashboard`) to ensure only authenticated users can access them
   - Show the main app (calendar, todos, etc.) if authenticated

4. **Sign Out:**

   - Add a sign-out button in the main app
   - Redirect to the landing page after signing out

5. **Store Todos (MVP):**
   - Use localStorage to store todos for now
   - Later, upgrade to a backend database for persistence

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Test NextAuth.js configuration
  - Test authentication state management

- **Integration Tests:**

  - Test the sign-in flow
  - Test the sign-out flow
  - Test protected routes

- **E2E Tests:**
  - Test the complete authentication flow
  - Test the main app access

## Notes and Considerations

- Ensure secure storage of OAuth credentials
- Follow NextAuth.js best practices
- Consider future upgrades (e.g., database storage for todos)
